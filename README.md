# 🌟 FocusOnToday - Daily Goals App

Hey!  
This is a small project I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main idea was to create a clean and simple app where I can add 3 goals every day and track my progress.

## ✍️ Why I made this

Just wanted to make something useful while learning JavaScript DOM. I also wanted a simple way to track small daily tasks and keep myself motivated.
